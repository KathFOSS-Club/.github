# KathFOSS 

## Who Are We?  

We are a community of passionate **Open Source enthusiasts** from **Kathford International College of Engineering and Management (KICEM)**. Our love for **Free and Open Source Software (FOSS)** drives us to create, collaborate, and share knowledge with everyone. Through events, workshops, and hackathons, we aim to spread the culture of programming and the power of FOSS.  

We foster an environment where everyone can explore their interests, develop their skills, and become mentors in areas they are passionate about. Whether youâ€™re new to FOSS or a seasoned contributor, **KathFOSS members are the go-to folks** for guidance, collaboration, and inspiration.
